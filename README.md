# UFOs
## Overview of Project
Dana’s webpage and dynamic table are working as intended, but she’d like to provide a more in-depth analysis of UFO sightings by allowing users to filter for multiple criteria at the same time. In addition to the date, we add table filters for the city, state, country, and shape.
## Results
After successfully building the webpage we now can filter on Data, City, State, Country, and Shape... the possibilities are endless when examining UFO sightings.

## Summary
This webpage is great for a simple view of the data, however, even with the availability of filters, it’s hard to manipulate and draw conclusions from the data. This is the biggest drawback because it makes it harder for data analysis.
